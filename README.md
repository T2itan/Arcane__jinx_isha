🎬 Arcane Fan Portal
A multi-page responsive website dedicated to the Netflix series Arcane. This project explores deep-world lore, character highlights, and the series' iconic soundtrack using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5.

## 📂 Project Structure
Based on the development environment, the project is organized as follows:

Plaintext
root/
├── index.html          # Main landing page with Arcane overview
├── chacters.html       # Character bios and details
├── pictures.html       # Gallery of series artwork and screenshots
├── songs.html          # Comprehensive list of songs by episode
├── styles.css          # Global styles for the landing page
├── charcters.css       # Specific styling for the character bios
├── songs.css           # Grid layout for the music section
└── README.md           # Project documentation
## ✨ Key Features
Responsive Grid Layout: Uses CSS Flexbox and Bootstrap 5 to ensure the site looks great on laptops, tablets, and desktops.

Dynamic Navigation: A custom-styled header allows seamless travel between the "Main Page," "Characters," "Pictures," and "Songs."

Themed Design: Utilizes a color palette inspired by the show’s "Piltover vs. Zaun" aesthetic (Teals, Oranges, and Dark Browns).

Media Integration: A dedicated gallery section for visual assets and an organized list of tracks from the soundtrack.

## 🖼️ Gallery & Visuals
The project includes a dedicated pictures.html page. It is designed to showcase high-quality stills and concept art from the show.

Implementation: Images are stored within the project directory and displayed using responsive CSS to ensure they don't overflow on smaller screens.

Styling: Pictures are wrapped in decorative borders to match the steampunk theme of the site.
